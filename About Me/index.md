
## About Me
Hello! My name is Robert and I am a full stack, cloud native, engineer. I started as a Trainer at a 
coding bootcamp, teaching Java full stack with Angular. During my time, I developed in-house 
applications and taught a myriad of technologies for/to junior engineers that were typically fresh
out of college/university. As tech stacks varied, so did my exploration of technology. I have a love
for that exploration and have become so much more than just a full stack engineer. 

## Full Stack Arc
I learned and used Java with Spring and Angular 8 for full stack applications. I would dabble in DevOps
and Cloud, but only slightly, as I learned my way around enterprise applications. I eventually migrated
to React with NodeJS and learned the intricacies around the runtimes and frameworks. I never stopped at 
just learning the high level basics and how to use them, but how they worked and why they would be used. 
I would often question what the reasons were on why they would be preferred and in what areas they would
outperform other options.

Overall, I dove into technologies and learned the ins and outs of their inner workings. I taught the 
technologies as a way to reinforce my own learnings. I loved learning more and being challenged in 
working with and understanding different languages and technologies. By the end of my tenure as a trainer
at the bootcamp, I learned, taught and used the following different languages, technologies, runtimes, 
and frameworks:
- Core Java
- Hibernate
- Java with Spring Framework (including, but not limited to, boot and data)
- Angular 2+
- React w/Typescript
- React Native
- NodeJS
- Express
- Oracle DB
- Postgres DB
- Linux computing
- Containerization
- Microservices Architecture and Design Patterns
- Messaging protocols Rest and Soap
- AWS DevOps, networking, EC2, RDS, and serverless services

Overall, I helped over 100 junior developers begin their career and taught myself an enormous amount
of in-depth knowledge and was tested on that knowledge by passing it on to all of them. I became 
exceptionally good at debugging applications and assisting junior developers with their projects and
career path.

## Cloud Engineering Arc
As coding began to become to stale, I journeyed deeper into cloud-native technologies, DevOps, and 
deployment environments such as Kubernetes and AWS Serverless.
